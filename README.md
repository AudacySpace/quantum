# Welcome to Quantum

Quantum is an Electronic Procedures Software used to run multiple procedures for Audacy space missions to achieve mission goals/tasks. Procedures are groups of tasks to be executed for implementing a mission’s operation by the mission operators with different assigned roles. Quantum gives mission operator ability to upload a procedure consisting of sections and steps to be completed, view uploaded procedures or run procedure instances.

The resulting software aims to achieve a modular front-end (allowing users to use and upload their procedures), and an REST API based backend (allowing users to drive displays from their specific data source). The user interface will be browser based, using the MEAN technology stack, incorporating rapid maintenance and upgradability while operating in a mission critical environment. 

## Vision
Audacy's vision is to make mission operation accessible to anyone who is pursuing space exploration. Every mission needs an operations management solution but not every team can afford to access these platforms.

You can use Quantum for handling procedures in your own mission operations environment, deployed on your own metal, customized to suit your mission needs. Then give back and contribute to the development community on GitHub.
